add_julython_hooks
==================

This is a script to add julython hooks


`bash add_julython_hooks.sh USERNAME REPONAME`


for some reason the julython hooks aren't working..

if you run in a terminal:

`nc -l 7700`

edit add_hook_test.sh, change: 'sente.cc:7700' to a domain:port of your choosing and then run it: `bash add_hook_test.sh`

and then commit your changes and push to github:
